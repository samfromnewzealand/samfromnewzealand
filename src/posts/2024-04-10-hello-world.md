# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and adventures from New Zealand with you all.

## Why I Started This Blog

I created this blog to document my journey and connect with like-minded individuals around the world. New Zealand is a beautiful country with unique culture and landscapes, and I hope to share some of that with you.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect:

- Stories from around New Zealand
- Tech tutorials and insights
- Personal reflections and experiences
- Photography from my travels

## The Technical Side

This blog is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a simple static site generator. I chose Eleventy because:

1. It's lightweight and flexible
2. It uses JavaScript, which I'm comfortable with
3. It allows me to write content in Markdown
4. The build process is incredibly fast

```javascript
// Example of an Eleventy config
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      output: "_site"
    }
  };
};
```

Looking forward to our journey together.
