      <p>Kia ora! I'm Sam from New Zealand, and this is my personal website where I share my experiences, thoughts, and adventures from Aotearoa (the Māori name for New Zealand).</p>
      
      <p>I grew up in Wellington, the windiest city in the world and New Zealand's capital. My passion for storytelling, photography, and web development has led me to create this space to connect with people around the globe.</p>
      
      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>With a background in digital media and environmental science, I spend my days working on conservation projects and my evenings coding and writing. This website is built using Eleventy (11ty) and is constantly evolving as I learn new skills.</p>
      
      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiking the beautiful trails of New Zealand</li>
        <li>Photography, especially landscapes and wildlife</li>
